# IT Fundamentals Lab

This personal lab project is designed to simulate real-world IT support and infrastructure scenarios as I transition into a career in IT operations. Over the coming weeks, Iâ€™ll be working through hands-on tasks involving Windows 11, Microsoft 365 administration, networking fundamentals, remote support, and device configuration - focusing on the core skills needed in modern IT environments.

My goal is to build a good foundation in both user support and infrastructure management, including endpoint administration, network troubleshooting, and cloud-based tools like Microsoft Intune and Azure.

## Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience supporting Windows 11 and Microsoft 365.
- Practice basic infrastructure tasks like user/device configuration, licensing, and networking.
- Simulate helpdesk scenarios (printers, account lockouts, remote access issues).
- Build PowerShell skills for automation.
- Learn tools used in enterprise environments (Intune, RDP, TeamViewer).

## Planned Lab Scenarios

### Windows 11 Troubleshooting
- [ ] Install and configure a Windows 11 VM.
- [ ] Simulate and resolve common issues (slow startup, driver failures, Group Policy settings).
- [ ] Manage local users and permissions.

### Microsoft 365 Administration
- [ ] Set up a Microsoft 365 Developer tenant.
- [ ] Create and manage user accounts and licenses.
- [ ] Reset passwords, configure MFA, explore Exchange and Teams admin settings.

### Basic Networking & Connectivity
- [ ] Map home network (router, IP ranges, DHCP).
- [ ] Use `ipconfig`, `ping`, and `tracert` to troubleshoot connectivity.
- [ ] Simulate DNS or firewall misconfiguration scenarios.

### Remote Access Tools
- [ ] Configure TeamViewer or Chrome Remote Desktop.
- [ ] Simulate user support sessions and remote troubleshooting.

### PowerShell Scripting
- [ ] Automate user creation and group assignments.
- [ ] Create scripts for disk cleanup or device info gathering.
- [ ] Explore script signing and execution policy basics.

## Timeline
